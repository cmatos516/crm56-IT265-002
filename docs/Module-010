[ ]


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Linked all of the UI stuff (menu, settings, tutorial, etc.) to my game so that everything works
  - Had the game manager box detect and destroy missed notes if no key is pressed

- **Challenges faced**:
  - Win screen doesn't pop up after song ends
  - Needle keeps surpassing the green
  - Notes very out of tempo

- **Solutions**:
  - TBD for the first two (Mixr Lab solutions)
  - Fixed the timing for the notes
  

#### Learnings
- New source of code that allows for my empty game manager box to track and destroy missed notes


#### Free Thinking
- In the final stretch, hoping this week is a free work period so I can go to mixr lab to ask for help
- No sleep for me this week, have to continue to tweak and refine stuff for final presentations
- 

#### Next Steps
- Continue to work on project
