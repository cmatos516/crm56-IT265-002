#### Goals for this Module

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Finished the Case Study discussion

- **Challenges faced**:
  - Thinking of what games to choose and what flaws there are specifically.

- **Solutions**:
  - Made a list, and chose from the ones with the most problems IMO.
  - From there, pinpoint which issues in the game I wanted to address.

#### Learnings
- N/A


#### Free Thinking
- Still sticking to strategy-based memory game
- Narrowed it down to either cozy witch or phantom thief/detective vibe
- Been watching/consuming a lot of phantom thief media, probably why I went in that direction
  

#### Next Steps
-Continue to gather sources and notes for turned-based memory games
- Continue pre-production stage for physical card game
