#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Finished the memory game part of my game

- **Challenges faced**:
  - Realized that I had to do a digital version of my physical prototype
  - Some of the controls for the memory game were a bit buggy
  - 

- **Solutions**:
  - Found a prototype of memory game from a previous project I did
  - Fixed some of the minor errors
  

#### Learnings
- New source of code that allows for my empty game manager box to track and destroy missed notes


#### Free Thinking
- In the final stretch, hoping this week is a free work period so I can go to mixr lab to ask for help
- Realized that I couldn't use my thesis since the concept of the game has to be the same as the physical prototype :(
- 

#### Next Steps
- Continue to work on project
