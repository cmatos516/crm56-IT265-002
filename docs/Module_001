  - N/A

  - N/A

#### Learnings
- Learning about what is/makes a game (not just about the features, but also the gameplay)
- There are games with stunning features that have bad gameplay, and games with simple features that do really well.


#### Free Thinking
- Memory game but with turn-based attacks(?)
- Lots of inspiration from the Pokemon TCG Pocket app, but where do I draw the line to make sure it's not a ripoff?
  


#### Next Steps
