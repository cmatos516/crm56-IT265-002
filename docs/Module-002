#### Learnings
- Gameplay is a lot more fun with simpler controls.


#### Free Thinking
- Definitely wanna do a strategy-based memory game

- Too many ideas/concepts for game style :(
  

#### Next Steps

- Start pre-production stage for physical card game
- Look for strategy gameplay via Pokemon TCGP
